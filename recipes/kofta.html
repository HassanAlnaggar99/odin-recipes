    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kofta is a popular dish made from grilled ground beef that is served throughout
      the Middle-East. This is a wonderful and simple version I picked up in Egypt. A
      great accompaniment is saffron rice.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg yolk, oregano,
        salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Pick up medium sized handfuls and press them onto skewers. Roll on a lightly
        oiled clean surface until the mixture looks like a large ground beef hot dog
         with about 1 1/2 inches at each end of the skewer. Place your fingers in the
          middle of the skewer and separate the meat log into two sausages with about
           1 inch of skewer sticking out at each end.</li>
      <li>Prepare a grill for high heat, or if you only have a grill pan, like myself,
         heat it over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Place the sausages on the grilling surface, and cook for about 10 minutes,
        turning once or twice for even cooking. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
